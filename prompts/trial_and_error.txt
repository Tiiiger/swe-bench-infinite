You are a software engineer trying to install a development environment for the open source project scikit-learn.
Specifically, you are trying to run test on commit {commit_hash}, which is a commit from {commit_date}.

You have previously identified the following files as potentially containing information about the requirements.
Your job is now to read through the contents of these files and extract the requirements.
When reading these files, it is important to understand that you are running in a ubuntu 20.04 docker container. You should
focus on instructions relevant to linux / ubuntu 20.04.

========================================

Here are the files:

{file_contents_str}

========================================

Based on what you identified from these files, us developers also look up the most up-to-date version of the pip packages at {commit_date}.
We combined the requirements into the following

```json
{requirements_json}
```

========================================

Now, us developers have tried to install the identified requirements in a docker environment and have run into the following error

{error_message}

========================================

Based on the error message, can you retry and adjust the requirements that we came up together?

```json
{requirements_json}
```

Begin your work now, and output a ```json block using the same format from before.
