You are a software engineer trying to install a development environment for the open source project scikit-learn.
Specifically, you are trying to run test on commit {commit_hash}, which is a commit from {commit_date}.

It is tricky to install the development environment from before, so your first step is to identify all the files that could
potentially contain information about the requirements.

Here are some examples that you should usually consider:
- requirements.txt
- requirements-dev.txt
- pyproject.toml
- setup.cfg
- setup.py
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- docs/contributing.rst

Next, I am going to provide you with the result of the bash command `tree -L 3`.

{tree_result}

Based on the tree, you must identify up to {top_k} files that you think are most likely to contain the information about the requirements.
Each file path should be relative to the root of the repository. Remember, your goal is to install the development environment so that you can contribute to the project.

You must output the list of files in a JSON array format. Make sure to include only a single ```json``` block in output, because we will use regex to grab your results.
For example:

```json
["requirements.txt", "requirements-dev.txt", "pyproject.toml", "CONTRIBUTING.md", "README.md"]
```

Now, begin your work!
