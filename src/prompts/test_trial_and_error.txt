You are a software engineer trying to install a development environment for the open source project {repo_name}.
Specifically, you are trying to run test on commit {commit_hash}, which is a commit from {commit_date}.

You have previously identified the following files as potentially containing information about the requirements.
Your job is now to read through the contents of these files and extract the requirements.
When reading these files, it is important to understand that you are running in a ubuntu 20.04 docker container. You should
focus on instructions relevant to linux / ubuntu 20.04.

========================================

Here are the files:

{file_contents_str}

========================================

Based on what you identified from these files, us developers also look up the most up-to-date version of the pip packages at {commit_date}.
We combined the requirements into the following

```json
{requirements_json}
```

========================================

We have successfully installed the above requirements and proceed to running test in this repo. We just run the following commands
{test_command}

However, we run into the following error
{error_message}

========================================

Usually, when these errors occur, usually there are some missing dependencies or dependencies that are installed at a wrong versions.
If you think this is the case, modify the requirement json below and output a ```json block using the same format from before.
If you think the error cannot be solved by updating the requirements, explain your reasoning and do not output any ```json block

```json
{requirements_json}
```
